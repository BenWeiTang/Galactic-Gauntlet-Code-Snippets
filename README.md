# Galactic-Gauntlet-Code-Snippets
This repo features several code snippets that highlight the work I did on the game Galactic Gauntlet for its veritcal slice during my COOP at Quadratron Games, Philadelphia, PA.

[Capture Zone](https://github.com/BenWeiTang/Galactic-Gauntlet-Code-Snippets/tree/main/CaptureZone) inlcudes scripts implemented as part of a game mode where the players strive to contest zones in the map and earn points.

[Procedural Level Generation](https://github.com/BenWeiTang/Galactic-Gauntlet-Code-Snippets/tree/main/ProceduralLevel) includes the scripts of my experimental work to implement a procedural level generation algorithm that produces connected rooms of regular polygon shapes.
